Test Document:

There is a bug in the program where the number of swaps is set to 0 for Bubble,Insertion,and Selection Sorts 
if those sorts are run consecutively. 
Also BubbleSort's comparisons are shown to be the same as Insertion if run consecutively as well.
Could not figure out why this bug keeps occurring.
The other sorts run correctly regardless of order.

If you check Bubble,Insertion or Selection Sorts by themselves the values for swaps/comparisons are shown correctly.


Tested the Sorts on sizes 100,1000,and 10000.
Compared the values against the expected Theoretical values below:

W(N) = worst case
B(N) = best case

Insertion Sort:
	W(N) = N^2
	B(N) = N
	Size 100: 99 Comparisons
	Size 1000 1098 Comparisons
	size 10000 11097 Comparisons
	Insertion Sort performed pretty well on the random lists at just 
	
Selection Sort:
	W(N) = N(N-1)/2 ~ O(N^2)
	B(N) = N^2
	Size 100: 4950
	Size 1000: 504450 comparisons
	Size 10000: 50499450 comparisons
	Selection Sort performed as expected at about N^2 comparisons

Bubble Sort
	W(N) = N^2
	B(N) = O(N)
	Size 100: 7920 comparisons
	Size 1000: 970956 comparisons
	Size 10000: 99801072 comparisons
	Bubble Sort performed just under the worst case scenario

Quick Sort
	W(N) = N^2
	B(N) = NLogN
	Size 100: 626 comparisons
	Size 1000: 8968 comparisons
	Size 10000: 110710 comparisons
	Quick Sort performed really well at around the best case scenario
	
Merge Sort
	W(N) = NLogN
	B(N) = NLogN
	Size 100: 544 comparisons
	Size 1000: 8705 comparisons
	Size 10000: 120203 comparisons
	Merge Sort performed as expected around at around best case scenario
Shell Sort
	W(N) = N
	B(N) = NLogN^2
	Size 100: 342 comparisons
	Size 1000: 5799 comparisons
	Size 10000: 81042  comparisons
	Shell Sort performed alright. Not at the best case scenario but nowhere near the worst case

Radix Sort
	W(N) = NK where K 
	B(N) = NK
	Size 100: 300 comparisons
	Size 1000: 3300 comparisons
	Size 10000: 33300  comparisons
	Radix Sort performed as expected
